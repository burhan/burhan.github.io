      <h1>Hardware</h1>
    </header>

    

<p>I recently switched from macos to Windows for my operating system. Although I have invested a lot in the macos ecosystem, the recent issues with keyboards on macbooks and the rising costs of mac hardware paired with a steady stream of improvements to WSL was enough for me to give Windows a sincere try.</p>

<h2 id="primary-machine">Primary Machine</h2>

<p>My primary development machine is a Dell <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/xps-15/spd/xps-15-9570-laptop">XPS 15 9570</a>, with the following configuration:</p>

<ul>
<li>Core i7 8750H CPU</li>
<li>32 GB DDR4 RAM</li>
<li>1TB M.2 2280</li>
<li>4K (3840x2160) touchscreen display</li>
</ul>

<p>It is paired to a 32&rdquo; 2560x1440 WQHD panel, and the best thing about it is that it comes with a stand so it can be converted to a (very large) portrait display; the exact model is the BenQ <a href="https://www.benqdirect.com/bl3200pt.html">BL3200PT</a>, but perhaps realizing that is a mouthful the new iteration of this monitor is called the PD3200Q.</p>

<p>The XPS is a great machine, except for the webcam postion which is horrible (they have since fixed it in the 2019 upgrade), and the keyboard is a bit too soft for my liking.</p>

<h2 id="travel-laptop">Travel Laptop</h2>

<p>My travel and commute laptop is the excellent Lenovo <a href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpad-x/ThinkPad-X1-Carbon-6th-Gen/p/22TP2TXX16G">X1 Carbon</a> now in its 6th generation. I could write a sonnet about this laptop, but here are the highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li>14&rdquo; 500-nit display - which is unfortunatately glossy, but very bright which is great for travel.</li>
<li>The best keyboard of any laptop. Period.</li>
<li>A webcam (with a hardware shutter)</li>
<li>A LTE modem built-in (this is a configurable option)</li>
<li>USB-C (x2), USB, HDMI and a microSD card reader built-in</li>
<li>NFC (only in Europe)</li>
</ul>

<p>This laptop is one of the best portable machines I have ever used. My only gripe with it is that it tends to be very aggresive with the fan. As a result the right side of the laptop gets quite warm and this is where I usually keep my external mouse so it tends to get annoying.</p>

<h2 id="miscellany">Miscellany</h2>

<p>Here are some other things that I enjoy using:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.bose.com/en_us/products/headphones/over_ear_headphones/quietcomfort-35-wireless-ii.html#v=qc35_ii_black">Bose QC35</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/mx-master-2s-flow">MX Master 2S</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.kensington.com/p/products/control/trackballs/expert-mouse-wired-trackball/">Kensington Expert Mouse Wired Trackball</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/products/keyboards/sculpt-ergonomic-desktop/l5v-00001">Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/spotlight-presentation-remote?crid=11">Spotlight Presentation Remote</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I <strong>highly recommend</strong> getting a set of hardware keys, I have a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BYSB7FK/">Yubico Security Key</a> and a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LYV6TQM/">Feitan MultiPass FIDO U2F</a>.</p>

<p>My go-to bag to carry my gear is the <a href="https://www.sfbags.com/collections/laptop-backpacks/products/pro-executive-laptop-backpack">Waterfield Pro Executive Laptop Backpack</a>; I can also recommend the <a href="https://www.sfbags.com/collections/laptop-backpacks/products/staad-laptop-backpack">Staad Laptop Backpack</a> if you carry minimal amount of gear. Waterfield&rsquo;s bags are hand-made, high quality and will last you a very, very long time. I am celebrating 10 years with my very first bag from them, and it has yet to form a rip or a tear.</p>

<h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h2>

<p>If you only want one laptop, get the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/surface-book-2/8mcpzjjcc98c?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab">Surface Book</a>, I would recommend the 15&rdquo; version. For a machine that can do it all and above, this is my recommendation and what I would buy today if I were to refresh my hardware.</p>

<p>If buying Lenovo hardware, it pays to wait. They are having excellent promotions and you can get away with some serious savings (I saved &gt;$800 on my purchase). Get a coupon for upto $200 off your first purchase if you create an account.</p>
